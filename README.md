# DiffusionMixStyle
This repository contains dataset samples and model checkpoints for DiffusionMixStyle, a deep learning model designed for panicle detection across a wide variety of sorghum phenotypes. A subset of the created sorghum diversity datasets from the experiments in the publication is made available for evaluation.

## Overview

DiffusionMixStyle was developed with Ultralytics YOLO11 based on PyTorch. Check the installation guide [here](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/).
